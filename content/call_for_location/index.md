EAAMO is seeking proposals from universities, institutes and other appropriate venues interested in hosting the 2026 ACM Conference on Equity and Access in Algorithms, Mechanisms, and Optimization (ACM EAAMO). 

ACM EAAMO aims to highlight work that advances our understanding of the societal embedding of technology and how techniques from algorithms, optimization, and mechanism design, along with insights from the social sciences and humanistic studies, can help improve equity and access to opportunity for underserved communities. The conference is currently in its fifth year, with previous iterations (since the first, virtual event) held at George Mason University, Boston University, the Autonomous University of San Luis Potos√≠, and the University of Pittsburgh. 

To register interest in hosting EAAMO, please send an email to ec@eaamo.org indicating the location and the names of one or two academics with ties to the institution that will host the conference and who would serve as the local chair(s). The executive committee of the conference will then contact the prospective chairs for further discussion on a rolling basis. Please also feel free to contact the address listed above with questions.  

Parameters for the event are as follows:
- EAAMO is held in the last week of October or first week of November.
- Space requirements:
  - One large lecture room with a capacity of at least 200 people.
  - One smaller room with capacity for at least 40 people.
  - Space for poster sessions (should accommodate around 20 posters).
  - Space for registration, coffee breaks, and lunch.
