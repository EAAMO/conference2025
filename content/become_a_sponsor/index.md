## What is EAAMO?

We are a community of over 3000 people coming from 130+ institutions in 50 countries, that bring together a range of expertise to tackle problems in marginalized groups around the world. The ACM EAAMO Conference highlights research at the intersection of algorithms, optimization, and mechanism design, along with insights from the social sciences and humanistic studies, with the purpose of improving equity and access to opportunity for underserved communities.

The 2025 conference at the University of Pittsburgh, USA will provide an inter-disciplinary forum for presenting research papers, problem pitches, survey and position papers, new datasets, and software demonstrations towards the goal of bridging research and practice. The conference will feature a hybrid program, facilitating both in-person as well as virtual participation.

**ACM EAAMO brings together domain experts, policy-makers, and community organizations**

We are an international and interdisciplinary community, with academic experts, community organizations, non-profit and governmental agencies, and industry participants. We are unique in attracting talent from all over the world, with a significant contingent from Mexico, Peru, Ethiopia, and Europe. ACM EAAMO has been seen rapid growth since its inception in 2021, with over 300 participants in the last year. In particular, we expect significant participation from the following categories:
- Academics from computer science, economics, operations research, law, sociology
- Government representatives, civic societies, and public servants
- Policy-makers in the space of AI, law, technology, urban planning, and resource allocation
- Non-profits and community organizations
- Professionals from major tech companies
- Local and international students

The work highlighted in the ACM EAAMO conference series is selected through a highly rigorous peer review process and published in the ACM Digital Library, which is a top-tier publication venue in the computational sciences. As such, the work presented is of high quality and has concrete impact on technology development and societal considerations. Our invited speakers are domain experts from various geographies and disciplines. We offer support for students and civic organizers to participate, with a major contingent in Latin America, Africa, and Europe. As such, we are unique in fostering a highly diverse participation and support programs ranging from cutting-edge academic contributions to [social hackathons](https://conference2024.eaamo.org/social_hackathon/), [mentoring programs in Indigenous communities of Mexico](https://www.eaamo.org/projects/rednacecyt-2024-summer-of-science-program), and [year-round working groups](https://bridges.eaamo.org/).
