This year, we are especially excited to announce **Community Events at EAAMO '25**, designed to center voices from Southwest Pennsylvania and beyond, and to explore what it means to do algorithmic work that truly serves the public good.

We are launching new community-focused programming that is uniquely local, yet globally significant. These events are designed to:
- Break down the walls and make a bridge between researchers and practitioners.
- Elevate local voices into global conversations.
- Co-create solutions with government, nonprofits, and community leaders.

Your participation, whether as a sponsor, collaborator, or attendee, will help ensure that this work is sustainable, inclusive, and grounded in the needs of real communities.

## Key Community Events
EAAMO community events are co-organized with the local academic and practitioner partners in our host city as a research to practice bridge.

<!-- ### Community Shark Tank
Researchers will pitch their projects to a panel of local community leaders, who will evaluate them based on relevance, feasibility, and community impact. -->

### Principles and Performance Metrics Makerspace
Responsibility frameworks suggest general principles such as fairness, accuracy, privacy, etc but are less clear on how to operationalize them into metrics. This event bring together researchers across disciplines to compare how principles are implemented in areas such as health metrics, social services, procurement, education, and others.

## Social Events
EAAMO will also be hosting social events as usual.

### Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens
Founded in 1893 as a gift from philanthropist Henry W. Phipps, Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens was created as a lush sanctuary for Pittsburghers seeking respite from the smoke and steel of the industrial age. Today, it remains a beloved landmark and one of Americaâ€™s greenest public gardens, showcasing breathtaking plant collections, immersive seasonal displays, and cutting-edge sustainable architecture. As an international leader in environmental innovation, Phipps continues to inspire visitors of all ages with its beauty, educational programs, and commitment to a greener future. 

*This visit to Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens is offered as an optional excursion during conference registration.*
