This year, we are especially excited to announce **Community Events at EAAMO '25**, designed to center voices from Southwest Pennsylvania and beyond, and to explore what it means to do algorithmic work that truly serves the public good.

We are launching new community-focused programming that is uniquely local, yet globally significant. These events are designed to:
- Break down the walls and make a bridge between researchers and practitioners.
- Elevate local voices into global conversations.
- Co-create solutions with government, nonprofits, and community leaders.

Your participation, whether as a sponsor, collaborator, or attendee, will help ensure that this work is sustainable, inclusive, and grounded in the needs of real communities.

## Key Community Events
EAAMO community events are co-organized with the local academic and practitioner partners in our host city as a research to practice bridge.

### Community Shark Tank
Researchers will pitch their projects to a panel of local community leaders, who will evaluate them based on relevance, feasibility, and community impact.

### Principles and Performance Metrics Makerspace
Responsibility frameworks suggest general principles such as fairness, accuracy, privacy, etc but are less clear on how to operationalize them into metrics. This event bring together researchers across disciplines to compare how principles are implemented in areas such as health metrics, social services, procurement, education, and others.
