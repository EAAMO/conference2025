This year, we are especially excited to announce **Community Events at EAAMO '25**, designed to center voices from Southwest Pennsylvania and beyond, and to explore what it means to do algorithmic work that truly serves the public good.

We are launching new community-focused programming that is uniquely local, yet globally significant. These events are designed to:
- Break down the walls and make a bridge between researchers and practitioners.
- Elevate local voices into global conversations.
- Co-create solutions with government, nonprofits, and community leaders.

Your participation, whether as a sponsor, collaborator, or attendee, will help ensure that this work is sustainable, inclusive, and grounded in the needs of real communities.

## Key Community Events
EAAMO community events are co-organized with the local academic and practitioner partners in our host city as a research to practice bridge.

<!-- ### Community Shark Tank
Researchers will pitch their projects to a panel of local community leaders, who will evaluate them based on relevance, feasibility, and community impact. -->

### Principles and Performance Metrics Makerspace
Responsible data science frameworks suggest general principles such as fairness, accuracy, accountability, etc. but provide scant structure for how to communicate and compare different implementations of these principles. This event convenes interdisciplinary data-centric and data-adjacent researchers into application areas for a two-day exploration. 

**(Nov. 6) Day 1:** Participants can choose between 3 breakout groups:
- **Public Sector AI / Procurement:** Imagine you're involved in the development or procurement of an AI system designed to detect housing conditions in a city. What principles are most important to you in this AI procurement process? What metrics or evidence would you expect—or be expected—to provide to demonstrate those principles are being upheld?
- **Health and Social Determinants:** As a social impact researcher, what are the challenges you face in choosing metrics to measure the well-being of the population you are benefitting? What are ways you measure social and health determinants and what criterion do you use to choose between metrics? How do you think this connects / does not connect with how the population perceives their well-being? 
- **Responsible Research:** Academia often talks about responsible research in broader principles such as integrity, accountability, or engagement. From your perspective, which of these principles are important, and how are they measured in your field? 

**(Nov. 7) Day 2:** We will synthesize the principles and metrics collected from each group and map out common understanding and potential misunderstanding, and how this will affect the policy process. We will find areas and subgroups for future collaborations.  

## Social Events
EAAMO will also be hosting social events as usual.

### Carnegie Museum Visit
Nestled in the Oakland-neighborhood of Pittsburgh, the [Carnegie Museums](https://carnegiemuseums.org/) of Pittsburgh encompass a remarkable cultural complex founded in the late 19th century by steel-tycoon and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie.

*This visit to Carnegie Museum is offered as an optional excursion during conference registration.*
