## About
EAAMO ’25 | OXFORD Local brings together researchers from computer science, economics, and the wider social sciences to tackle issues around social good. We believe now is a pivotal moment to reflect on how these disciplines can come together—not least to assess the risks, as well as the opportunities, that AI (and digitisation) brings to this space.

The event will be held alongside the fifth **ACM Conference on Equity and Access in Algorithms, Mechanisms, and Optimization (EAAMO'25)** at the University of Pittsburgh, USA.

We will also host the participants of the **EAAMO‑REDNACECYT Summer of Science 2025**. The students will present their research in Oxford. They will also take part in a series of seminars, workshops, and activities in a separate event in London (8–9 November) — London website (*link coming soon*).

## Call for Submissions
We invite submissions that advance access to opportunity for historically underserved and disadvantaged communities while addressing inequitable or unsafe outcomes.

We accept submissions that have been published elsewhere and that are also being presented at EAAMO’25.

### Topics of interest include
- Machine learning, optimization, and mechanism design approaches to reducing social and economic inefficiencies and unsafe outcomes
- Ethical, economic, legal, philosophical, and societal considerations of algorithmically driven systems
- Redistributive mechanisms aimed at improving access and achieving equitable outcomes
- Micro‑ and macroeconomic impacts of inequality and market inefficiencies
- Causal factors of harm, such as exploitative or biased behaviors, market failures, and overall inequities
- Uncertainty, safety, privacy, and fairness in allocation and representation systems
- Algorithmic and societal challenges in resource‑constrained computing environments
- Trustworthy and valid inference in socially consequential domains
- Data governance: collection, curation, protection, sharing, and transparency for research on access and equity
- Community empowerment tools: algorithmic methods that encourage participation and collective action for the common good
- Policy and regulatory design related to data, privacy, fairness, equity, and access to opportunity

**Application domains of interest include (among others):** civic participation, data economies, discrimination and bias, digital/economic inequalities, economic development, education, environment & climate, food security, healthcare, housing, infrastructure, labor markets, law & policy, low‑ and under‑resourced computing, social and economic mobility, privacy, public services, recommender systems, social work, sustainable development, and transportation.

### Submission types may include
- Research papers  
- Surveys  
- Position papers  
- Problem‑ or practice‑driven contributions  
- Workshops (1h)

We welcome work from academics and practitioners across diverse disciplines and sectors. The reviewing process will be **single‑blind** and **single phase** (without rebuttal). The reviewers will also choose a **prize winner** among all submissions.
