### About the Walking seminars and In-situ discussions

**Walking Seminar 1: AI and Higher Education**

A walking seminar that explores the intersection of artificial intelligence and higher education. Participants will move through selected areas of London while engaging in critical discussions on AI-driven transformations in teaching, learning, and research. This seminar emphasises active reflection, collaborative dialogue, and connecting theory with the urban environment.

**In-situ Discussion 1: Diversification in AI (National Gallery)**

An in-situ discussion held at the National Gallery, using the museum space to frame conversations on diversity and inclusivity in AI research and practice. Participants will examine case studies, ethical considerations, and structural challenges, grounding their dialogue in the context of curation, representation, and cultural artefacts.

**Walking Seminar 2: The Environmental, Social, and Political Impact of AI**

A walking seminar that investigates the global consequences of AI technologies, from environmental costs to social and political effects. As participants traverse London, they will explore the real-world implications of AI supply chains, sustainability challenges, and power asymmetries, combining spatial awareness with critical discussion.

**In-situ Discussion 2: Decolonisation in AI (British Museum)**

An in-situ discussion at the British Museum focusing on decolonisation in AI research and technology deployment. Using the museum’s collections as a springboard, participants will critically engage with historical and contemporary inequalities in AI, data governance, and algorithmic systems, linking abstract concepts to tangible cultural and societal contexts.
