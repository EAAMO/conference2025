Please take a look at our past conferences, where scholars and practicioners from around the world gathered to share their research and ideas. Our archives provide detailed information on accepted papers and posters, invited talks, and various events such as social events, faculty networking opportunities, and doctoral consortium programs, all aimed at improving equity and access to opportunity for historically disadvantaged and underserved communities though the use of algorithms, optimization, and mechanism design, along with insights from the social sciences and humanistic studies.
