The fifth ACM Conference on Equity and Access in Algorithms, Mechanisms, and Optimization (ACM EAAMO ‘25) will take place November 5-7, 2025 in the University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA. The event will highlight work along the research-to-practice pipeline to improve access to opportunity for historically underserved and disadvantaged communities and mitigate harms concerning inequitable and unsafe outcomes. In particular, we seek contributions from different fields that offer insights into the intersectional design and impacts of algorithms, optimization, and mechanism design with a grounding in the social sciences and humanistic studies. Submissions include research, surveys, position papers, and problem- and practice-driven submissions by academics and practitioners from different disciplines or sectors.

## Call for Doctoral Consortium Participation

ACM EAAMO ‘25 will feature a doctoral consortium for students who have interests relevant to the conference. The event will allow students to meet other students in the field, learn about related career paths, have an opportunity to present their work, participate in dedicated skills sessions, and have meetings with faculty mentors. While primarily targeted at PhD students, the doctoral consortium is open as well to undergraduate and masters students. Content will be primarily designed for students in computer science, operations research, and economics programs, but students from all fields are welcome to apply. Depending on funding availability, some travel support may be available. 

Note that doctoral consortium contributions do not result in an accepted paper and are fully compatible with later submission of the work to a peer-reviewed venue.
