The fifth ACM Conference on Equity and Access in Algorithms, Mechanisms, and Optimization (EAAMO ‘25) will occur **November 5–7, 2025** in University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.

The event will highlight work along the research-to-practice pipeline to improve access to opportunity for historically underserved and disadvantaged communities and mitigate harms concerning inequitable and unsafe outcomes. In particular, we seek contributions from different fields that offer insights into the intersectional design and impacts of algorithms, optimization, and mechanism design, including those with a grounding in the social sciences and humanistic studies. Submissions can include research, surveys, position papers, and problem- and practice-driven submissions by academics and practitioners from different disciplines or sectors.

### Important Dates
* Abstract Submission Deadline: April 24, 2025 (AoE)
* Paper Submission Deadline: May 01, 2025 (AoE)
* Paper Submission Page: [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=ACM.org/EAAMO/2025/Conference)
* Submission Notification: July 18, 2025
* Event Dates: November 5 - 7, 2025

#### Important news:
Also, we’re officially supporting hybrid presentations for anyone with difficulty traveling.

#### Reviewing
We ask each submission to nominate one author to serve as a reviewer for EAAMO'25, to help the review process. Reviewers typically have some (but not necessarily all) of the following qualifications:
 - Hold a Ph.D. in a relevant field or pursuing a graduate degree or hold relative work experience
 - Published at least 2 papers as first author in a relevant conference or journal
 - Served as a reviewer at any related conference or journal
 - Be an author on at least 3 peer-reviewed papers (this can include non-archival venues like workshops) on relevant topics
 - Be active in EAAMO working groups

Please feel free to contact the chairs ([pc25@eaamo.org](mailto:pc25@eaamo.org)) for an exception if you believe that your author team does not have someone qualified to be a reviewer. Papers who have authors who are otherwise helping with organizing EAAMO (area chair, already reviewing, organizing in some other capacity) are exempt from this requirement.

### Areas of Interest
We invite submissions on topics, methodologies, and approaches including, but not limited to:
* ethical, economic, legal, philosophical, and societal considerations of algorithmically-driven interventions
* redistributive mechanisms for improving access to opportunity and equitable outcomes
* micro- and macroeconomic consequences of inequality and market inefficiencies
* determinants and causes of harm, including inequitable outcomes, market failures, exploitative behavior, and economic inefficiencies
* machine learning, optimization, and mechanism design for alleviating inefficiencies, inequitable, and unsafe economic and social outcomes
* uncertainty, safety, privacy, and equity in allocative and representational systems
* algorithmic, ethical, policy, and societal challenges in computing in resource-constrained settings
* reliable, trustworthy, and valid inference in societally-consequential domains
* data collection, curation, governance, protection, and sharing efforts for work related to improving access to opportunity
* algorithmic approaches and tools to encourage participation, empower, and organize communities for the collective good
* regulation and policy design related to data, privacy, equity, fairness, and access to opportunity

Application areas of interest include, among others, civic participation, data economies, discrimination and bias, digital and economic inequalities, economic development, education, environment and climate, food security, healthcare, housing, infrastructure, labor markets, law and policy, low- and under-resourced computing, social and economic mobility, privacy, public service provision, recommender systems, social work, sustainable development, and transportation.

### Tracks
Submissions can introduce new theories and applications or can be position papers providing a method-driven literature review, synthesizing perspectives, or highlighting future directions. We welcome contributions that propose new general methodologies and those that emphasize applied work, policy issues, or practical problems. Submissions will be reviewed in one of six tracks:
* **AI and Machine Learning**, including AI for social impact, bias and fairness considerations in statistical reasoning, learning and decision making in an economic context, optimization, fair division and allocation in resource-constrained settings, interactions in multi-agent and socio-technical systems, causal analysis of algorithmic interventions and their long-term effects, social choice, work at the intersection with privacy and security, human factors in algorithms, and sociotechnical considerations in AI deployment.
* **Applied and Quantitative Modeling**, including proposing and analyzing applied and structural models for novel practical problems in data science, computational social science, industrial organization, market and mechanism design, micro- and macroeconomics, and operations management (e.g., supply chain, service operations).
* **Datasets and Benchmarks** involving submissions of novel datasets and benchmarks collected and documented to foster new research in different application domains, creating new standards for data collection, transparency, and accountability and fostering interdisciplinary collaborations. The submission should include the dataset, which will be uploaded as a supplementary file, and metadata information. The dataset may also be uploaded to external data-sharing services, and the conference will provide an additional option for a data portal upon acceptance of the submission. The submission should be accompanied by a document detailing the application domain, the potential for use of the data, and any known issues, limitations, and ethical considerations for the collection, curation, access, and use. Authors are encouraged to consider questions presented in the datasheets for dataset recommendations.
* **Empirical Studies** including 1) empirical analysis of existing social systems, policies, and mechanisms, and other domains such as empirical industrial organization/health/education/labor; 2) empirical evaluation of systems that incorporate computational tools such as algorithms, mechanisms, or optimization; and 3) description and qualitative or quantitative analyses of deployments of systems by the researchers.
* **Position Papers and Problem Pitches** that present a novel position, idea or open a new area of discussion regarding a particular research topic related to the scope of the conference. Submissions will be evaluated based on their novelty and potential to offer new organizing principles for a field, fostering new perspectives and bridges between research and policy/practice.
* **Theory** includes theoretical analysis in algorithm design, fair division, and resource allocation, game theory, market and mechanism design, behavioral models, optimization, operations management, computational social choice, social network analysis, economic theory, and machine learning theory.

### Submission Instructions
Submissions will have the option to be either archival or non-archival. For papers in disciplinary areas where archival conference papers are the norm, preference will be given to archival submissions. 

**Archival option**:  accepted papers in this option will be published in the conference proceedings in the ACM Digital Library. The archival option welcomes submissions that constitute new research papers not published in conference proceedings or journals. 

**Non-archival option**: this option welcomes unpublished work, work under simultaneous submission to a journal or conference (in compliance with the rules of the other venue), and research papers published recently, no earlier than January 1, 2025. Please include a citation in the submission system if the work is already published. Papers in the non-archival option will not be published as part of the conference proceedings and may be submitted in the future to an archival venue, if not already published. 

**Note regarding decisions and presentations**: Papers accepted as a full paper (under either archival or non-archival options) will present either as a long oral presentation or as a poster/short presentation; archival and non-archival choice will not be considered for these decisions. We may also have workshop poster presentations for papers not accepted as full papers. This allows authors to present work to the community at a poster session to get feedback but does not result in a publication in the conference proceedings. 

**Formatting**: there are no formatting or length requirements for the PDF submission, but accepted archival papers will have a page limit of at most 14 pages in the camera-ready version at the time of publication, using the ACM Traditional Camera Ready Submission [template](http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template). In addition to the PDF, authors are asked to upload a 200-250 word description in the submission system summarizing their submission and its relevance to the conference.

**Anonymity**: **submissions are double-blind**. Authors should take care not to include the names and affiliations of the authors in the paper, including when referring to previous work. Submitters should list all co-authors on the submitted work in EasyChair but not in the PDF of the submission. Citations to the authors’ own previous work should be written in the third person; e.g., instead of “We previously developed…(Smith, 2019)”, write “Smith (2019) previously developed…”. If this would compromise the paper's clarity (i.e., it is necessary to identify previous work as belonging to the authors), use an anonymous citation, e.g., (Anonymous, 2019). These can be replaced in the camera-ready version. Additionally, wherever possible, authors should avoid referring to specific institutional details in the paper that could reveal their names or affiliations (for example “our team included officials from a large U.S. city” instead of “our team included officials from New York City”). However, institutional information may be included if it is necessary to the research content of the paper, even if it is suggestive of author affiliations.

**Ethical considerations**: Papers submitted to EAAMO are expected to engage with ethical challenges and implications of the work presented, and the review process will consider the soundness of such engagement alongside technical soundness. We strongly encourage papers to discuss ethical concerns or unintended adverse impacts that could result from the publication of the work, along with any precautions taken to mitigate these issues. For papers accepted in the archival track, this discussion may be included in a separate statement (up to 1 page long) that does not count towards the overall page limit.

For research that involves human participants or that uses sensitive data, it is particularly important that the paper describes steps taken to adhere to ethical norms for human subjects research, e.g., informed consent, protection of privacy, and how risks to participants were assessed and handled. The paper should also include disclosure regarding whether the study was approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) if such review is required (e.g., for human subjects research conducted by university members).

**Language**: We will only accept submissions in the English language. The conference is committed to building multilingual communities and aims to allow submissions in other languages at future events.

**Financial support**: we aim to increase accessibility by offering financial assistance to attend the conference. The application for this program will be available soon at conference.eaamo.org.

**ACM policies**: By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all [ACM Publications Policies](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies), including ACM's new [Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects). Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.
 
Please ensure that you and your co-authors [obtain an ORCID ID](https://orcid.org/register), so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper.  ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a [commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors](https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/orcid-faqs). We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.
