At ACM EAAMO'25, we are committed to building an inclusive, accessible, and diverse conference. To help remove barriers to participation, we are pleased to offer financial assistance to attendees who need it.

We especially encourage applications from those with accepted papers, [posters](cfp/call_for_posters), or those joining the [doctoral consortium](cfp/call_for_doctoral_consortium). However, anyone interested in attending is welcome to apply.

### What We Offer
Our financial assistance includes:
- In-person registration fee waiver
- Virtual registration fee waiver
- Travel grant (to help cover travel and lodging)

### How to Apply
Our travel grant chairs are here to help and will respond quickly to any questions. Please apply only if you do not have access to other funding, and request the minimum necessary support so we can help as many participants as possible.
