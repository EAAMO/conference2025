## About
EAAMO '25 | CAPE TOWN Local will bring together Cape Town–based researchers and students who share an interest in the EAAMO mission of building a research community that places the perspectives and interests of marginalized groups at the foundation of algorithmic and resource allocation systems.

The event will be held alongside the fifth *ACM Conference on Equity and Access in Algorithms, Mechanisms, and Optimization (EAAMO'25)* at the University of Pittsburgh, USA.

In addition to invited talks, participants will have opportunities to connect with attendees at the main EAAMO conference in Pittsburgh and the local event in Oxford.

*More information coming soon.*
