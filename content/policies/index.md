## EAAMO Code of Conduct

The goal of EAAMO’25 is to highlight multi-institutional, collaborative work that draws on multiple disciplines and engages historically underserved and disadvantaged communities to improve access to opportunity for such communities. Toward this goal, it is critical that all participants at the conference respect, understand, and value the importance of contributions from a diverse group of participants, and especially those from historically underserved and disadvantaged communities. 

Organizers of EAAMO’25 ask that all conference participants adhere to the [ACM Policy Against Harassment and Discrimination](https://www.acm.org/special-interest-groups/volunteer-resources/officers-manual/policy-against-discrimination-and-harassment), as well as the [EAAMO Code of Conduct](https://www.eaamo.org/policies). Any violations of either code of conduct can be reported via the ACM or EAAMO reporting procedures, or submitted via email to ec@eaamo.org.

## Sponsorship Policy

EAAMO seek sponsorship to support year-round activities within the EAAMO community and to improve access to the ACM EAAMO conference. These activities include financial inclusion initiatives (e.g. data grants, fee waivers), research and implementation seed-grants, summer programs, as well as operational costs associated with the initiative and conference. Funding sources include charitable foundations, companies, individual donors, and government and international agencies. 

We follow several guidelines and policies related to fundraising activities: 
- A committee comprising representatives from the conference executive committee, EAAMO Directors, and conference co-chairs runs all sponsorship activities within EAAMO.
- The sponsorship committee will report all activities related to soliciting, accepting, and dispersing funding to the conference leadership committee and the EAAMO Directors to ensure such activities align with the EAAMO mission and vision.
- The sponsorship committee will seek funding from diverse sources, including academic institutions, charitable organizations, foundations, industry, and government sources.
- The sponsorship committee will specify the list of sponsors and any benefits associated with sponsoring the initiative and/or conference. This information will be available on the respective websites.
- Sponsors will not have any designated attendance slots in the conference.
- The conference organizing team will decide on the conference program independent of any input from any sponsors.
- EAAMO-sponsored projects will be independent from sponsor input.
- Sponsorship for the ACM EAAMO conference should be unrestricted within the conference's purview. Sponsors wishing to fund specific projects within the EAAMO organization can contact the leadership to discuss this case-by-case.
- EAAMO will acknowledge sponsors supporting the broader initiative and conference on the website and other relevant materials.
- EAAMO reserves the right to decline or return any funding if the sponsorship committee decides that the funding source is misaligned with the mission of the initiative and conference. 

Please contact ec@eaamo.org with any questions or concerns.
